Right now I'm using [hyprscroller](https://github.com/dawsers/hyprscroller) that is a scrollable tiling of windows. Similar windows managers are [PaperWM](https://github.com/paperwm/PaperWM), [Karousel](https://github.com/peterfajdiga/karousel), [Niri](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri), [papersway](https://spwhitton.name/tech/code/papersway/).

In a scrollable window manager, windows are arranged in columns on an infinite strip going to the right. Every new window does not resize previous windows, but it is added in a new column of the stripe. All windows remain readable, in case their column is in the current visible area. 

There is a direct relationship between spatial (i.e. the windows on the screen) and temporal locality (i.e. the task to complete), because the recently opened windows are near together. Windows can be moved, like paper on a desk.
